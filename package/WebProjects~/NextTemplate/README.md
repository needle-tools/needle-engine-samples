This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) adding the `needle-engine` web component.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Needle Engine
This project is a minimal example of adding `needle-engine` to a nextjs project

- `needle-config.json`  
  Added the `baseUrl` config to `./assets` to change codegen (`src/generated/gen`) to point to the next.js local server relative url
- `next.config.js`  
  Include the nextjs plugin which handles `transpilePackages`, webpack `defines` and licensing
- `src/needleEngine.tsx`  
  This is a simple next component for including the `needle-engine` web component. 
  make sure to also add the type declarations from `src/declarations.d.ts`  
- `src/pages/index.tsx`  
  Import the component to run client-side:  
  ```tsx
  const NeedleEngine = dynamic(() => import('../needleEngine'), { ssr: false })
  ```
