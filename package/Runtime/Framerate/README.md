# Framerate Limiting

Control your application's framerate to ensure stable performance, prevent device overheating, and optimize battery life - especially important for mobile and XR experiences.

## Use Cases

Prevent thermal throttling on mobile devices during extended sessions, conserve battery life for mobile users, ensure consistent performance across different devices, or match your framerate to display refresh rates.

## What This Sample Shows

Set a target framerate to balance visual smoothness with performance and battery usage. Lower framerates (30-45 FPS) can significantly extend session times and prevent devices from overheating, while still providing a smooth experience.

This is particularly important for:
- Mobile AR/VR experiences that run for extended periods
- Battery-powered devices where power consumption matters
- Preventing thermal throttling that causes inconsistent performance
