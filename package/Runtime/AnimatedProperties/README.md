# Animated Properties

You can animate anything in Needle Engine: object properties, materials, components, lights or cameras. 

This sample showcases how to animate:

 - Material properties such as color, roughness, texture transforms
 - Blendshapes and morph targets
 - Object position, rotation and scale. It also works for bones of a skinned / skeletal meshes
 - Light parameters
