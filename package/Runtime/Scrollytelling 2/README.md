# Scrollytelling 2

A scroll-driven 3D experience using the `ScrollFollow` component to animate objects, materials, and physics properties as the user scrolls through the page.

## What This Sample Shows

- **ScrollFollow** — The new `ScrollFollow` component drives object animations based on scroll position, without needing Timeline
- **Material Animation** — Material properties like color and opacity animate in response to scroll
- **Physics Properties** — Physics parameters change as you scroll through sections
- **FollowCursor** — Mouse-reactive elements add interactivity on top of the scroll-driven animation
- **No Code Required** — Everything is set up with built-in components in Unity

Simply create animations in Unity — they work automatically on the web, driven by scroll position.
