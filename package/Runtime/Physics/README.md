# Physics

Create realistic physical interactions in your web experiences using familiar Unity physics components - `Rigidbody`, colliders, physics materials, and joints all work on the web without any code changes.

## Use Cases

Build interactive physics puzzles, realistic product demonstrations with gravity and collisions, dynamic simulations, or fun physics-based games that run directly in the browser.

## What This Sample Shows

- **Rigidbody Physics** - Objects respond to gravity, forces, and collisions using the built-in physics engine (Rapier)
- **Multiple Collider Types** - Box, Sphere, Capsule, and Mesh colliders all work seamlessly
- **Physics Materials** - Control friction and bounciness to create realistic material interactions
- **Physics Joints** - Connect objects with various joint types for complex mechanical behaviors
- **Collision Events** - React to physics interactions with `onCollisionEnter`, `onCollisionStay`, and `onCollisionExit`

## Components Used

Just add Unity physics components to your objects:
- **Rigidbody** for dynamic physics simulation
- **Colliders** (Box, Sphere, Capsule, Mesh) for collision detection
- **Physics Materials** to define surface properties
- **Joints** for connecting objects mechanically

For advanced control, you can access the underlying Rapier physics engine directly from TypeScript.
