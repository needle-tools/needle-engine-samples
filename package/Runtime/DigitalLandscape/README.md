# Digital Landscape

A showcase of custom Shader Graph rendering in Needle Engine. A stylized landscape is generated entirely through a vertex-displacing shader, demonstrating how advanced Unity shaders translate to the web.

## What This Sample Shows

- **Custom Shader Graph** — The `LandscapeGraph` shader transforms a flat plane into terrain geometry using vertex displacement
- **Shader Graph to Web** — Visual shader programming in Unity that works automatically on the web
- **Post-Processing** — Depth of field and bloom create an atmospheric, cinematic look
- **Interactive Camera** — `OrbitControls` lets you explore the scene

Built with Unity's Shader Graph and URP. Simply create animations in Unity's Animation window — they work automatically on the web.
