# Device Detection

Adapt your experience for different devices - show simplified content on mobile, enable advanced features on desktop, or create device-specific interactions.

## Use Cases

Optimize performance by showing lower-poly models on mobile devices, enable touch-specific controls for tablets, show different UI layouts for desktop vs mobile, or provide device-appropriate instructions.

## What This Sample Shows

The **DeviceFlag** component makes it easy to show or hide objects based on the device type. Simply add it to any GameObject and choose whether to show it on desktop, mobile, or both.

You can also detect specific browsers, operating systems, or XR devices in your TypeScript code for more advanced customization.
