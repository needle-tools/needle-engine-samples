# Depth Sensing

Blend virtual objects with your real environment (passthrough).

Depth sensing is a [WebXR feature](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr-depth-sensing-1/), currently supported only on Quest devices.

You can enable it on the WebXR component.

Objects **do not** require a special shader. Everything works out of the box!
