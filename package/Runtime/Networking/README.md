# Networking samples

Needle is equipped with a built-in networking solution right at the core. We provide components for common use cases and make it easy to network variables with just one typescript decorator. For more information, please refer to the [networking documentation](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/networking.html).

## Networking Animator
Synchronizes an Animator without writing code! The SyncedAnimator component will handle this for your and synchronize animation state to all users in the same networking session.

## Auto Network (@syncField)
Showcases how to synchronize an array of strings. The purpose here is to educate on the [@syncField decorator](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/reference/typescript-decorators.html#examples) and that it also supports arrays (as well as strings, bools, numbers...)
