# Networking samples

Needle is equipped with a built-in networking solution right at the core. We provide components for common use cases and make it easy to network variables with just one typescript decorator. For more information, please refer to the [networking documentation](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/how-to-guides/networking/).

Showcases how to synchronize an array of strings. The purpose here is to educate on the [@syncField decorator](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/reference/typescript-decorators.html#examples) and that it also supports arrays (as well as strings, bools, numbers...)
