# Ground Projection sample

[Equirectangular panorama](https://polyhaven.com/hdris) is a form of projection for 360 photos which are often used as a __skybox__, which is in fact a big sphere glued to the camera. So based on that, we can create our sphere and change its shape by flattening the bottom 40% which results in a hemisphere with a beveled floor. And that is the principle behind Ground Projection.

### With basic parameters, you can define this deformation and tweak that to your liking:

- Scale - sphere's scale
- Radius - density of the floor
- Height - density on the sides

## RemoteSkybox

Is a component that lets you download a skybox from other sources. This means that you can set a link where the panorama is hosted instead of including it in the build, this can reduce the initial download size.
