# Animated Materials

Bring your materials to life by animating any property - color, metallic, roughness, texture transforms, and more. Create dynamic visual effects without writing shader code.

## What This Sample Shows

Needle Engine can animate any material property using Unity's Animation system. This sample demonstrates animating all the key properties of the MeshPhysicalMaterial:
- Color, emissive, and transmission
- Metallic and roughness values
- Texture offset and scale transforms
- Clearcoat and other advanced properties

Simply create animations in Unity's Animation window - they work automatically on the web.
