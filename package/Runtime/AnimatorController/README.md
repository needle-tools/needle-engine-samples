# Animator Controller

The Animator Controller is a state machine for animations, allowing you to specify that a transition between animations can occur only when certain conditions are met.

These conditions are:
 - Trigger - "One-use ticket"
    - Example: "Jump" or "Attack"
 - Boolean - "true or false state"
    - Example: "IsGrounded" or "IsAttacking"
 - Numbers which you can compare to
    - less, more, equel... 
    - Example: "Speed" or "Elevation"

You can also not use any conditions and just transition from one animation to another by just specifying how to blend between these two animations. This way you can chain them after each other in a sequence. 

Here we have two animations, open and close, and we jump between them with a trigger called "Toggle".

You can open this Animator Controller asset located at `AnimatorController/Assets/Crate AnimatorController` by double clicing on it.

Mind that you can click on the states and the transitions (the white arrows) to see *its settings* in the inspector.

It is very important not to forget about animation loop time. In other words, if the animation will be looping or if it will stop at the last frame and hang there. You can set the `loop time` boolean directly on an animation file or in the animation tab of the model import settings. For looping animations such as walking, you want to set it to true. But for animation such as "close door", you don't want the door to be endlessly closing.

For example here in this sample, we don't want any looping, therefore both the animations have the loop time disabled. 

For more information about the Animator Controller, please visit the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html).

This sample also showcases that you can make "simple" logic such as chest opening and closing without **any code knowledge**.
