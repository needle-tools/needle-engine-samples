# SvelteKit Sample

This sample demonstrates integrating Needle Engine and SvelteKit. This allows building complex web applications with multiple routes, server integration, or static page generation.

The sample currently uses `adapter-static` to output a statically generated page. This can be deployed anywhere. If you want to use dynamic routes and a backend server, switch to `adapter-auto`.
