# Musical Instrument

An interactive 3D instrument where tapping on individual parts triggers sounds and animations — built entirely with no-code [Everywhere Actions](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/how-to-guides/everywhere-actions/).

## Key Features

- **Click-to-Play** — Each instrument part is interactive using `PlayAudioOnClick` and `PlayAnimationOnClick`
- **Audio & Animation Sync** — Clicking triggers both a sound effect and a visual animation simultaneously
- **iOS AR Export** — The interactions are packaged into an interactive USDZ file for AR Quick Look on iOS
- **No Code Required** — Everything is configured with built-in components in the Unity editor

## Customization Ideas

- Replace the model with your own instrument and assign different sounds per part
- Add particle effects on interaction for visual feedback
- Combine with Timeline for sequenced playback
- Add TypeScript components for more complex behaviors like looping or layered sounds
