**PlayAudioOnClick** component plays a sound when you click on an object it is on. The key difference between this component and having a UI button and calling `AudioSource.Play()` in the click method, is that it is an Everywhere Action, which means it works even in QuickLook (iOS AR).

The sample also showcases the **PlayAnimationOnClick** component, so you are free to combine as many actions as you see fit.
