# CharacterController
*(Third person controller)*

It is a component familiar to Unity developers that implements a set of functions to handle a character. It's generally faster to use the CharacterController than starting from scratch.

This sample implements the character controller in the CharacterControllerInput.ts and adds the basic capabilities like WSAD movement, jumping and double jumping while also driving the animator.
