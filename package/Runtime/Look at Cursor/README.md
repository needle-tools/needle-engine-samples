# Look at Cursor

Create engaging interactive headers and embeds where 3D characters track your mouse movement - built entirely with no-code components.

## Use Cases

Perfect for interactive website headers, engaging product mascots, immersive portfolio pieces, or any scenario where you want 3D characters to feel alive and responsive to user interaction.

## What This Sample Shows

This cute website header was created with just built-in Needle Engine components. Move your mouse over the screen to see the 3D character look at it and the plants around react to movement.

**Components Used:**
- **LookAt** - Makes the character's head and eyes turn towards a target
- **FollowCursor** - Tracks mouse position to create the target point

No custom code required - just add these components in Unity and they work automatically on the web!
