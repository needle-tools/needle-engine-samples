# Multi Camera

Render multiple camera views simultaneously on the same screen - perfect for security camera displays, split-screen effects, picture-in-picture setups, or creative multi-perspective presentations.

## Use Cases

Create surveillance camera interfaces, split-screen racing games, picture-in-picture tutorials, product showcases from multiple angles, or creative installations with multiple simultaneous viewpoints.

## What This Sample Shows

Multiple cameras render their views onto different regions of the screen. The HTML rectangles can be dragged and resized, and their size and position determine where each camera's view appears. Each view is rendered sequentially, and the final result composites all cameras together.

This technique allows you to create complex multi-view interfaces using standard Unity cameras and simple HTML/CSS for positioning.
