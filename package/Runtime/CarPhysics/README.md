# Car Physics
Rapier is a powerful engine containing raycast vehicle physics logic which this sample utilizes.

Car physics is comprised of two elements, the body and the wheels. It is a good practice to separate the 3D model of the wheel from the wheel physics object.

If the car behaves in an unstable manner, please refer to the values in the `CarPhysics` and `CarWheel` scripts in this sample.
You can also use `debugcarphysics` and `debugwheel` debug parameters to visualize the armature of the car.
