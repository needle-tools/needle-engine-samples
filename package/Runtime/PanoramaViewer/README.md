# Panorama Viewer

Allows for viewing 360Â° images and videos with gyroscope controls or drag controls.

Files are added directly in the inspector, with support to add them programmatically as well.

The component creates its own panorama sphere and transitions between textures.

Panoramas need to be [equirectangular](https://polyhaven.com/hdris).
