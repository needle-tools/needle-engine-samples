# HTML Layout Adjustments

As Needle Engine integrates 3D elements seamlessly into websites, the surrounding page can be created and styled with HTML and CSS as usual. The `<needle-engine>` element itself can also be styled, animated, and so on.  

See [the docs on the needle-engine element](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/reference/needle-engine-attributes.html) for more details.
