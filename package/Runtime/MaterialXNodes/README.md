# [Material X](https://materialx.org/)

Material X is a widely supported shader system that allows for easy shader definition across various ecosystems.

It supports both node graphs for easy iteration and a code-driven approach, enabling you to construct shaders with an approachable high-level API directly in JavaScript/TypeScript.

There are more options when choosing a Material X editor:
- [QuiltiX](ttps://github.com/PrismPipeline/QuiltiX)
- [Official editor](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/blob/main/documents/DeveloperGuide/GraphEditor.md)
