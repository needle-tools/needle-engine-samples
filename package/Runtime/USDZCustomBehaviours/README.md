# Voxel Editor
Very basic voxel editor made with Everywhere Actions. 

Needle Engine [Everywhere Actions](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/how-to-guides/everywhere-actions/) are a set of carefully chosen components that allow you to create interactive experiences in Unity without writing a single line of code.
They are designed to serve as building blocks for experiences across the web, mobile and XR, including Augmented Reality on iOS.
