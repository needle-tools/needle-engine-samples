# Spatial Audio

Spatial or 3D audio is important while making believable experiences where volume is driven by the distance from an AudioSource.   
This sample showcases that by moving around instruments. Make sure to also try it in VR or AR.

## How it Works

The Sample is built using Needle Engine [Everywhere Actions](https://engine.needle.tools/docs/everywhere-actions.html) - a set of carefully chosen components that allow you to create interactive experiences in Unity without writing a single line of code.
They are designed to serve as building blocks for experiences across the web, mobile and XR, including Augmented Reality on iOS.
